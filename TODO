(in no particular order)

* Make sure there are methods for easy to searching for a date or date range
* Include TYPE constants, and complete the status_string() method and others. (see http://forums.gbpvr.com/showthread.php?t=4399&highlight=recording_schedule+statuses for reference)

* make make a bundle so it's easier for people w/o DBI, DBD::ODBC, Class::DBI to get them installed
* add docs for making exes from perl (mention PAR, perl2exe, etc .. link to perlmonks.com nodes)
* register namespace https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=apply_mod
* add alias methods for american vs british spellings (e.g. favorite as alias to favourite)
